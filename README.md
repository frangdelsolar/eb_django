## NOTES

This is a Django project to consume the EasyBrokerAPI as a part of a technical test. The basic goal is to create a Property List page that consumes data from the api and displays upto fifteen properties. Also there should be functional pagination to retrieve bunchs of data at a time. In addition, a basic Detail View was created to test redirections and a different data call from the api.

For styling, it is being used the Bootstrap framework with some basic customization.

There is some basic testing for the api call as well as the list view. Although, there is not much coverage.
