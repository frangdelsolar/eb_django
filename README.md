# EasyBroker Technical Test

by Francisco Javier Gonz√°lez del Solar

## How to run this project

1. Clone repository in a folder of your preference running the command.

   'git clone https://github.com/frangdelsolar/eb_django.git'

2. Open your terminal in the same folder and run the following command to install the required dependencies.

   'pip install -r requirements.txt'

3. If you are running locally, create a '.env' file in your root directory with the EasyBroker Authorization token. Otherwise, set an environment varible like this.

   'EB_TOKEN=RightTokenForEasyBrokerAPI'

4. Run the following command to navigate the project:

   'python manage.py runserver'

## NOTES

This is a Django project to consume the EasyBrokerAPI as a part of a technical test. The basic goal is to create a Property List page that consumes data from the api and displays upto fifteen properties. Also there should be functional pagination to retrieve bunchs of data at a time.

This is a much shorter project than the Angular version of this test, given the time constraints.

#### Things I'd like t

- Better error handling

- Carousel is not working properly
